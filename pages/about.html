  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p class="about-intro">
    I am a Ph.D. scholar in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering
    at the Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad, supervised by
    <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/prataprameshwaryadav/" target="_blank">
      Dr. Rameswar Pratap
    </a>.

  <p>
    My current research focuses on designing efficient and accurate sketching
algorithms for high-dimensional multimodal tensor data. I work on randomized
methods for dimensionality reduction and similarity estimation, aiming to make
large-scale machine learning faster and more scalable while preserving important
information in the data.
